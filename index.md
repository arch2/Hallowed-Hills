### Important Notes


## Session 1 

> 4/15/21 _The Crew_

Linq asks for a simple tea and boomer decided to join him. "I really want to see how you drink with your feet bro." Krrven takes a look around (13 perc) and notice the bar is heavily guarded. Maeve retired to her room. 

Yurin played with the band on stage for a bit. Once Yurin steps down an energy takes control of him; Yurin has been cursed by a witch because of the spawn he has abandoned. He is currently cursed with less perception (-2) and more acrobatics (+1), and walks up on stage and says "Hey thats a lot of people," the band looks at him and asks "Are you alright?" Yurin responds "Yea I'm fine stranger danger."

Zach walks up to the bar and adjusts his hand and reattaches to his wrist (14 med) allowed the skin the graft together. 

Morning comes and we meet back in the bar, Krrven grabs some food. Boomer comes down with a strong stench, Morgen comes in to ask of our status. Boomer attempts to offer some of his mushrooms (8 pers) and says "Merry Breakfast." Morgen clearly ignores him and turns to Maeve "So what do you plan to do today." Maeve pleads that we have no where near enough information to be effecient with this operation. Morgen explains some more information but then claims "I trust you but don't know much about your crew, so you'll need someone I can trust more, and he waves over to Basil (Chad).

Basil - well connected Yuan Ti sorcerer. Best friend was doing time and he's looking for some answers. Has two large arms with a snake tail bottom. His crew are usually all named after herbs. Morgen then leaves after introducing us.

We walk as a group over to the bakery. The sign just says "The Bakery." Maeve asks for the main baker, the baker at the front confused at first waves us to the door at the back. Before the group walks into the back room, Krrven asks for a biscuit and a raven rams into the glass window. Zach walks out to see the bird has turned back into the statue he found on his tombstone. 

In the back room of the bakery Boomer attempts to offer (3 pers) "The Baker" some mushrooms. Baker walks over and looks through a giant file drawer and asks what we are looking for. He explains the proprietor of the building is Jack and he recently came into some wealth. Maeve tries (2 pers) to discern more into what the Baker is trying to explain. Krrven asks who runs the city the Baker explains Moe runs the east side, Hans and Grits run the north side, Valeria runs the south, and Jack and "Humpty" is fighting for the west side.
