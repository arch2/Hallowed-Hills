### Important Notes


## Session 1 

> 4/15/21 The Crew

Linq asks for a simple tea and boomer decided to join him. "I really want to see how you drink with your feet bro." Krrven takes a look around (13 perc) and notice the bar is heavily guarded. Maeve retired to her room. 

Yurin played with the band on stage for a bit. Once Yurin steps down an energy takes control of him; Yurin has been cursed by a witch because of the spawn he has abandoned. He is currently cursed with less perception (-2) and more acrobatics (+1), and walks up on stage and says "Hey thats a lot of people," the band looks at him and asks "Are you alright?" Yurin responds "Yea I'm fine stranger danger."

Zach walks up to the bar and adjusts his hand and reattaches to his wrist (14 med) allowed the skin the graft together. 

Morning comes and we meet back in the bar, Krrven grabs some food.
